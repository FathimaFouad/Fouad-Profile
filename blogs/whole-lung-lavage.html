            <p>
              WHOLE LUNG LAVAGE (WLL) remains the gold standard therapy for
              Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis(PAP) which is a rare disease
              characterized by alveolar accumulation of surfactant material with
              resulting hypoxemia and reduced lung function.In WLL it removes
              proteinaceous material from affected lung and it provides a long
              lasting benefits in majority of the patients. Here we have come up
              with the case of 32 year old male presented with chief complaints
              of Dyspnea on exertion since 3 months,progressed from mmrc 2-3 in
              1month,dry cough 3months which was evaluated from outside
              hospital.There HRCT was done which showed B/L lung crazy pavement
              appearance,S/o PAP? Infective?
              PFT-FEV1/FVC=0.811(97%),FEV=2.4(57%),FVC=2.96(59%).There
              diagnostic BAL(Broncho Alveolar Lavage) was performed which was
              labelled as Non Proteinosis fluid and PAP stain negative and
              referred to Narayana Hrudayalaya for further evaluation.

              <p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
              <p>
                In NH patient underwent VATS Biopsy(Vedio Thoracoscopic Biopsy)
                and was reported as PULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS [HDE:Amorphus
                Easinophilic PAS positive material within alveoli].Pateint was
                admitted for WLL ,he was found to have left sided Pneumothorax
                .Managed conservatively in MICU for one day with O2
                support.Since left lung was already compromised due to
                pneumothorax WLL was postponed for four days.

              <p><strong>Results</strong></p>
              <p>
                Patient underwent WLL for left lung which was performed under
                General anaesthesis with lung separation obtained by Double
                Lumen Endotracheal tube.While Mechanical Ventilation was
                maintained in Right lung,the contralateral lung was repeatedly
                filled with 10200ml warm saline and then drained by
                gravity[retrieved 10100ml of protenosis fluid].The lavage was
                accompanied by chest percussion to emulsify the surfactant
                sediment and was continued until the lavage fluid became
                clear,judged by visual inspection. After five days patient
                underwent WLL for right lung with 10500ml warm saline and
                retrieved 10300ml proteinosis fluid.

                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                <p>
                  WLL remains First line therapy for PAP.Patient showed
                  improvement in dyspnea,PaO2,vital capacity and DLCO.WLL is
                  currently a safe procedure in an experienced setting and
                  yields durable benefit in majority of patients.
